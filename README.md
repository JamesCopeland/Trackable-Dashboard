# Trackable-Dashboard

## Description
This is the frontend website for my Trackable demo app. The app is simply a task-tracking app that will allow users to create, edit, and delete their tasks 
as well as track their open tasks over time. 

The backend is a simple API built on ASP.Net Core which connects to an Azure SQL database. Please view the repo for it here: https://github.com/JamesCopeland/Trackable_API

The frontend was built using Bootstrap 4 from a Microsoft MSAL starter solution which can be found at: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-b2c-javascript-spa

## Release 0.1
The initial release only includes create and delete functionality and does not have authentication built-in yet.

More releases are to come with more complete functionality and features!

The website is only hosted on Github pages currently. 

## Release 0.2
This release includes authentication with Azure AD B2C and also has the web-app hosted as an Azure static site!
